TBD (Tau Be Damned) aims to help researchers and the public know if the protein they are interested in is an IDP. By training a machine learning algorithm our aim is to identify the probability of a protein sequence being disordered. This result will be displayed underneath the input sequence as well as with a plot depicting the sequence parts most prone to disorder.

Alzheimer's disease affects more than 6 million Americans, this number is expected to double by the year 2050 with the aging popopulation [1]. A protein implicated in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases is tau. Tau belongs to a group of proteins called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). While globular proteins fold neatly into an ordered three-dimensional structure an IDP lacks this ability, although many IDPs can adopt a fixed structure after binding to macromolecules. Currently, there are no medications to prevent Alzheimer's, this can be attributed to the challenge of creating drugs targeting the minima for an IDP while it is less difficult to develop a drug to target the minima of globular protein, see figure 1. De novo protein designed is a technique that can contribute to pharmaceutical development of novel drugs with desired properties at a low cost and time-efficient manner.
