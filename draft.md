#User Cases
Vicky is a researcher interested in IDPs. They want this software to tell them if the protein they are working with is disordered.They are familiar with protein research and are interested in simple interface that would require sequence input and produce clearlabels for each region of the sequence.
Patrick is a computer science student with experience in machine learning. They are capable of training the model and updating the model if more components are required.

#Authenticate User Case Use Case:
User: Go to website with user interface
ML: Display "input protein sequence file"
User: inputs protein sequence file
ML: outputs the original sequence inputted with percentage of disordered below the sequence with visuals aids
