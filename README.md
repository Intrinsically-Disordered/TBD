# Project TBD [Tau Be Damned]

-------------------------

The project TBD [Tau Be Damned] aims to use the amino acid sequence of a protein to identify whether it is disordered.

## Project Objective

-------------------------

Our goal is to build a tool to identify whether a protein is disordered based on its amino acid sequence. We have collected amino acid
sequences for ordered and disordered proteins from publicly available datasets to train a machine learning model to perform the
classification task.

## Mission

-------------------------

We share an interest in proteins.
While many proteins fold into regular conformations which can be easily analyzed on a structural basis, intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) do not. IDPs like tau are implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to employ machine learning tools to improve the study of IDPs for scientific researchers and citizen scientists alike.

## Use Cases

------------------------

This project aims to be of use to the general public with interest in learning about classifying proteins, scientists determining if the protein they are working with or designed is disordered, and by those with experience in machine learning.
