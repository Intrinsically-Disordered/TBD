# Project TBD [Tau Be Damned]

-------------------------

The project TBD [Tau Be Damned] aims to use the amino acide sequence of a protein to identify whether it is disordered.

## Project Objective

-------------------------

Our goal is to build a tool to identigy whether a protein is disordered bases on its amino acid sequence. We have collected amino acid
sequences for ordered and disordered proteins from publicly available datasets to train a machine learning model to perform the
identificaction task.

## Mission

-------------------------

We share an interest in proteins.
While many proteins fold into regular conformations which can be easily analyzed on a strcutural basis, intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) do not. IDPs like tau are implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.
