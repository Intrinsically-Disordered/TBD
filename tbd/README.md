### Project TBD: Main Package

Here's the codebase for project TBD.


### Module Descriptions:

* __preprocessing.py__         :  Functions related to data cleaning and data processing.
* __model.py__        :  Functions related to modeling of a convolutional neural network (CNN).
* __predict.py__      :  Functions related to predicting whether protein sequences are ordered or disordered using a pre-trained model or newly trained model.
* __evaluate.py__   :  Functions related to evaluting the trained model.
* __utils.py__   :  Utility functions that can be used by other modules.
* __tests__ : Test suites for each of the modules above.
* pretrained_model: (Not a script) a pre-trained model ready to be used for prediction.
