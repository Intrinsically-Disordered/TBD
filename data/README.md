# Data

## Ordered protein structures

The <code> rcsb_pdb_sequence*.csv</code> files are drawn from the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org">RCSB Protein Data Bank</a>. Two files were required because they were too large to be downloaded from the server as a single csv file. These structures contain exactly one protein chain and were solved using either x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, or electron crystallography. Duplicate sequences are removed during the preprocessing stage. Accessed November 9, 2021.
 
## Disordered protein structures

The <code> disordered_sequences.csv</code> file contains a list of sequences from the <a href="https://disprot.org">DisProt</a> database. This database contains a curated list of intrinsically disordered proteins collected from the literature. All proteins in the database (from all organisms) were included in this data set. Duplicate sequences are removed during the preprocessing stage. Accessed November 9, 2021.
