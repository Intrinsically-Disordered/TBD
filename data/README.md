# Data

## Ordered protein structures

The <code> rcsb_pdb_sequence*.csv</code> files are drawn from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/). Two files were required because they were too large to be downloaded from the server as a single csv file. These structures contain exactly one protein chain and were solved using either x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, or electron crystallography. Accessed November 9, 2021.

## Disordered protein structures

The <code> disordered_sequences.csv</code> file contains a list of sequences from the DisProt database (https://disprot.org/). This database contains a curated list of intrinsically disordered proteins collected from the literature. Accessed November 9, 2021.
